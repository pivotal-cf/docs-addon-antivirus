title: Updating ClamAV Add-on for PCF to Run with Xenial Stemcells
owner: Security Engineering
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) products and tiles that are released after July 2018 require
Ubuntu Xenial stemcells instead of Ubuntu Trusty stemcells. 
You might have to modify your ClamAV Add-on for PCF deployment
if you use PCF products running on Xenial.

This topic describes how to determine if your existing deployment of
ClamAV Add-on can protect VMs that run on Xenial.

This topic also explains how to update your ClamAV Add-on if it does not support Xenial.

Follow the instructions on this page if you use ClamAV Add-on with any PCF products or tiles 
that use Xenial stemcells.
See [Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells](#which) below.

##<a id="who-me"></a> Do I Need to Modify the ClamAV Add-on?

ClamAV Add-on v1.4.28 and later can run correctly on Xenial-based VMs if the ClamAV runtime config
includes the `ubuntu-xenial` property. 

Review the following table and make any required changes before you upgrade to Xenial stemcells.

<table class="nice">
    <col width="25%">
    <col width="75%">
    <th>If you are using this version of the ClamAV Add-on…</td>
    <th>do the following…</td>
    <tr>
      <td>1.4.29</td>
      <td>Verify that your runtime config file, <code>clamav.yml</code>, includes 
<pre>
stemcell:
- os: ubuntu-trusty
- os: ubuntu-xenial
</pre>
        If it does not, then follow the procedure, <a href="#add">Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to ClamAV Add-on</a> below.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>v1.4.28</td>
            <td>Follow the procedure, <a href="#add">Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to the ClamAV Add-on</a> below.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>v1.4.5 or earlier</td>
            <td>Install ClamAV Add-on v1.4.29.</td>
          </tr>
</table>

If you use ClamAV Add-on without adding the `ubuntu-xenial` property to the runtime config, 
the VMs running on Xenial are not scanned for viruses.

If you add the `ubuntu-xenial` property but do not upgrade the ClamAV Add-on to v1.4.28 or later,
then the ClamAV processes use excessive CPU.

## <a id="which"></a> Product Tiles that Use Xenial Stemcells

Ensure that you have added the `ubuntu-xenial` property to the ClamAV runtime config
before you install any product tiles that use Xenial stemcells.

For a list of PCF tile releases that now use Xenial, 
see [Tiles Using Xenial Stemcells in PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/stemcells/xenial-tiles.html.

##<a id="add"></a> Add the Xenial Stemcell Property to the ClamAV Add-on

If you use ClamAV Add-on v1.4.28 or later  without the `ubuntu-xenial` 
property in the runtime config, then you must add it to your
existing `clamav.yml` and redeploy.

Follow these steps:

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
   For instructions, see [SSH into Ops Manager](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

2. To retrieve and save the ClamAV add-on runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT runtime-config –name clamav > /tmp/clamav.yml
    ```

    Where `BOSH-ENVIRONMENT` is the alias you set for the BOSH Director.

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh2 -e my-env runtime-config –name clamav > /tmp/clamav.yml </pre> 


3. Edit the `clamav.yml` file to add `- os: ubuntu-xenial` under 
    `properties: {}` as shown below:


    ```
    addons:
    - name: clamav
      jobs:
      - name: clamav
        release: clamav
        properties: {}
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ubuntu-trusty
        - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```

4. (Optional) If you plan to update to PAS for Windows v2.3, do Step 3 of [Add the windows1803 Stemcell
   to the ClamAV Add-on](./updating-for-pasw.html#add).

4. To update the runtime config, run the following command:

    ```
    bosh2 -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav /tmp/clamav.yml
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">bosh2 -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /tmp/clamav.yml</pre> 

5. Navigate to the Installation Dashboard in Ops Manager.

6. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html).

7. Click **Apply Changes**.
