This topic is an overview of <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="about-antivirus"></a>Overview

<%= vars.product_full %> might be necessary for regulatory purposes if your compliance auditor
requires antivirus protection within your <%= vars.ops_manager %> environment.

For example, auditors sometimes expect that antivirus protection is present in an
environment that must comply with standards such as the Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard (PCI DSS) or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

<%= vars.product_full %> complies with the U.S. Department of Defense STIG rule SV-92701r1_rule,
version UBTU-16-030900, which belongs to group SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227.

##<a id="features"></a> Features
  * Includes open source ClamAV packaged as part of the tile for installation.
  * Contains a private <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> tile for deployment and providing VMs to the foundation.
    * <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> serves both air-gapped and non-air-gapped environments.
    * The tile authenticates and validates publicly downloaded database definition files
      for added security.
  * Ability to scan VMs and containers for foundations with <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> and Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>.
  * Supports scheduled scans to reduce workload during peak operation hours.
  * Permits adding known signatures to an allowlist.
  * Allows you to configure CPU and memory usage limits on VMs of the foundation.

###<a id="propagate"></a>How Virus Definitions Propagate to VMs

Virus definitions on the internal <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> update
automatically or manually depending on whether your <%= vars.ops_manager %>
is on an online or air-gapped network, as described in [Updating Virus Definitions on an <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>](./updating-databases.html).
The automatic and manual processes store new virus definitions to the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>
VM's database of unverified viruses as follows:

* **Automatic update**: The `freshclam` daemon process on the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> VM downloads the virus definitions
and stores them in the internal mirror VM's unverified database.
* **Manual update**: The operator runs `bosh scp` to directly copy the virus definitions
to the internal mirror's database of unverified viruses.

From the unverified internal mirror database, virus definitions then propagate to BOSH VMs as follows:

1. The database verifier process on the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> verifies
  the date, format, and integrity of the new virus definitions.
  - To verify integrity, the verifier checks bytecode signatures against signatures
    in the external ClamAV database, using the external database public key.
  - If verification fails or if the virus definitions are not new, the mirror VM generates an error.
    See [Virus Database Update Issues](./troubleshooting.html#updates).

1. The internal <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> VM saves verified virus definitions to its verified database
and serves them to the `freshclam` processes of BOSH VMs.

1. On each BOSH-managed VM:

    1. The `go-clam-tls` daemon process regularly queries the internal <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> for new virus definitions.
      - You can configure the query frequency in the <%= vars.product_full %> tile > **ClamAV Configuration** > **Number of database checks per day** field.

    1. When `go-clam-tls` retrieves new definitions, it:
      - Notifies the `clamd` daemon process that there are new definitions, and
      - Saves the virus definitions in the BOSH VM's own virus database.

    1. The `clamd` process loads the new virus definitions into active memory to enable fast scanning
    by the `clamscan` process.

The diagrams below illustrate how new virus definitions propagate
from an external ClamAV database to <%= vars.ops_manager %> managed BOSH VMs,
in online and air-gapped installations.

###<a id="propagate-online"></a>Online Network (Diagram)

This diagram illustrates how virus definitions propagate to BOSH VMs with <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> using mutual TLS (mTLS):

![Online (non-air-gapped) update process, following path of new virus data.
External ClamAV database in the cloud serves new virus data to freshclam running
on Anti-Virus Mirror VM in the TAS for VMs deployment.
The Anti-Virus Mirror VM runs it through the database verifier,
which is also on the Anti-Virus Mirror VM,
and then using mTLS serves it to go-clam-tls on all BOSH VMs.
On each BOSH VM that is running Anti-Virus for VMware Tanzu, go-clam-tls notifies clamd that there are new definitions,
and saves the definitions in the virus database.
clamd then loads the new virus definitions from the database into its memory to
enable fast scanning.](update-defs-online.jpg)

###<a id="propagate-airgap"></a>Air-Gapped Network (Diagram)

This diagram illustrates how virus definitions propagate to BOSH VMs with <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> using mTLS:

![Air-gapped update process, following path of new virus data.
Operators download virus data from External ClamAV database in the cloud to an online workstation.
They transfer the virus data to the air-gapped off-line workstation.
The operators then run BOSH SCP to send the data to freshclam running on Anti-Virus Mirror VM in the TAS for VMs deployment.
The Anti-Virus Mirror VM runs it through the database verifier,
which is also on the Anti-Virus Mirror VM,
and then using mTLS serves it to go-clam-tls on all BOSH VMs.
