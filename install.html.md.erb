This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %>.

Before installing <%= vars.product_short %>, VMware recommends that you download
and install the Anti-Virus for VMware Tanzu Mirror tile.
For more information about the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> tile,
see [Installing and Configuring Anti-Virus for VMware Tanzu Mirror](./install-mirror.html).

##<a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To install <%= vars.product_short %>, you must have:

* **An Ops Manager operator user account with admin rights**.
For more information, see [Platform Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/platform-operators.html) in the Ops
Manager documentation.

* **<%= vars.ops_manager_full %> (Ops Manager)**.
For compatible versions, see the [Product Snapshot](./index.html#snapshot).

* **At least 2&nbsp;GB of RAM free for each VM that installs <%= vars.product_short %>**.
  <%= vars.product_short %> installs itself on each tile VM and runs internally. <%= vars.product_short %> takes at least 1.3&nbsp;GB of RAM on each VM.
  On Google Cloud Platform (GCP), the recommended minimum VM size is `micro.cpu` using 2&nbsp;CPU and 2&nbsp;GB RAM.

* **An external mirror**. If you do not have an external mirror, VMware recommends that you install
  the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>.
  For instructions, see [Installing and Configuring Anti-Virus for VMware Tanzu Mirror](./install-mirror.html).

## <a id='install-addon'></a> Install <%= vars.product_short %>

Install the <%= vars.product_short %> tile on the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard:

1. Download the product file from [<%= vars.product_network %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon).

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and select **Import a Product** to upload the product file.

1. Under the **Import a Product** button, click **+** next to the version number of <%= vars.product_short %>.
This adds the tile to your staging area.

1. Click the newly added **<%= vars.product_full %>** tile.

## <a id='configure'></a> Configure <%= vars.product_short %>

To configure <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Select **Anti-Virus Configuration**.

1. Configure **Mirror for Automatic Database Updates**.<br>
Use the **Official Mirror**, **Deployed**, **Existing Mirror**, or **Existing Mirror with TLS** information below.

1. Click **Save**.

If a scan reports false positives, report the issue to
[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp).
For more information about false positives, see
[Anti-Virus Reports False Positives](./troubleshooting.html#false-positive-clamav).
It takes about a week for ClamAV to verify and publish a new database.


## <a id='proxy'></a> Configure HTTP Proxy

If you require a proxy server for <%= vars.product_short %> jobs to connect to the internet to
update their virus definitions, you can configure one:

1. Select **HTTP Proxy Configuration for Anti-Virus Jobs**.
    ![Screenshot of the "HTTP Proxy" pane. The fields are listed below.](images/http-proxy.png)

1. Set **HTTP proxy for Anti-Virus jobs to get database updates** to **Enabled**.
1. Enter the **Host**, **Port**, **Username** and **Password** in the fields that appear.
1. Click **Save**.


## <a id='scheduled'></a> Configure Scheduled Scan

You can configure <%= vars.product_short %> to run a virus scan `hourly` or `daily`.
The default value is `daily`.
The format of these values must be in 24-hour format `HH:MM`.

To change the scheduled scan value:

1. Select **Scheduled Scans**.
    ![Screenshot of the Scheduled Scans pane with the Daily radio button selected.
      The fields exposed are the "Earliest time that a daily scheduled scan can start" field
      (must be in HH:MM 24-hour format) and
      the "Latest time that a daily scheduled scan can start" field.](images/scheduled-scans.png)

1. Set **Interval for scheduled scans to run** to one of these options:
  * **Hourly**
  * **Daily** (default)
  * **Disabled**
1. (Optional) If you selected **Daily** scheduled scans, you can restrict the interval.
To do this, set **Earliest time that a daily scheduled scan can start** and
**Latest time that a daily scheduled scan can start**.
1. Click **Save**.

## <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration

Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes.
To do so:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Ensure all products are selected and click **Apply Changes**.

<br>
<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#333;" />

## <a id="scan-containers"></a> (Optional) Configure <%= vars.product_short %> to Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers

You can use <%= vars.product_short %> to scan:

* Garden containers on the Diego Cell VMs in <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>).
* Containers on the Kubernetes worker node VMs in Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>).

However, duplicate logs about the same file appear under the `diff`,
`rootfs`, or `merged` directories as a consequence of OverlayFS implementation.

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to ignore duplicate logs for these directories, see the optional
[Exclude Duplicate Logs on Garden Containers](#garden) or
[Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers in Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>](#pks) sections below:


### <a id="garden"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Garden Containers

When <%= vars.product_short %> scan results detect potential malware on Garden containers,
logs are reported for both the `diff` and `rootfs` directories.

This is because the `rootfs` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer, therefore it is safe to
ignore the `rootfs` directory.
GrootFS mounts the underlying volumes using OverlayFS to a point in the images directory.
This mount point is the `rootfs` directory for the container and is read-write.

For more information about GrootFS OverlayFS implementation, see
[Volumes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/grootfs-disk.html#volumes)
in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

#### Procedure

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to ignore duplicate logs for these directories:

1. Select **Anti-Virus Configuration**.
1. Enter the following ignore pattern into the **Directories and files that will
be ignored** field:

    ```
    ^/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/(un)?privileged/images/[\w-]+/rootfs/.*$
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the "Directories and files that will be ignored" field.
      The text "/proc/,/sys/" is entered in the field.](images/ignore-file.png)
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
      <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/unprivileged/images/UUID/rootfs</code>
      directory are ignored by <%= vars.product_short %>.
      <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.
    </p>
1. Click **Save**.
1. To apply the configuration change, follow the instructions in
[Apply Changes from Your Configuration](#apply-changes) above.

For an example log entry, see [Container Log Messages](./monitoring-logs.html#container).


### <a id="pks"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers in Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>

When <%= vars.product_short %> scan results detect potential malware on containers of the Kubernetes
worker node VMs in Enterprise <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, logs are reported for both the
`diff` and `merged` directories.

This is because the `merged` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer, therefore it is safe to
ignore the `merged` directory.

For more information about Docker OverlayFS implementation, see
[Use the OverlayFS storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/)
in the Docker documentation.

#### Procedure

To configure <%= vars.product_short %> to ignore duplicate logs for these directories:

1. Select **Anti-Virus Configuration**.
1. Enter the following ignore pattern into the **Directories and files that will
be ignored** field:

    ```
    ^/var/vcap/store/docker/docker/overlay2/\w+/merged/.*$
    ```
    ![Screenshot of the "Directories and files that will be ignored" field.
      The text "/proc/,/sys/" is entered in the field.](images/ignore-file.png)
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
      <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/unprivileged/images/UUID/merged</code>
      directory are ignored by <%= vars.product_short %>. <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.
