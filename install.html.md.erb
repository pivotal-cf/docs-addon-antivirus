This topic describes how to install and configure <%= vars.product_full %>.

Before installing <%= vars.product_full %>, Pivotal recommends that you download
and install the ClamAV Mirror for PCF tile.
For more information about the ClamAV Mirror for PCF tile,
see [Installing and Configuring ClamAV Mirror for PCF](./install-mirror.html).

##<a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To install ClamAV Add-on for PCF, you must have the following:

* **A PCF operator with admin rights**.
For more information, see [Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/user-types.html#operator).

* **PCF Operations Manager (Ops Manager)**.
For compatible versions, see the [Product Snapshot](./index.html#snapshot).

* **At least 1&nbsp;GB of memory free on each VM**.
  ClamAV Add-on uses 610&nbsp;MB of memory.

* **An external mirror**. If you do not have an external mirror, Pivotal recommends that you install
  the ClamAV Mirror for PCF.
  For instructions, see [Installing and Configuring ClamAV Mirror for PCF](./install-mirror.html).

<%# TODO Chris: Is there a list anywhere to find signatures that can be ignored in "List of signature names that will be ignored by ClamAV (Used for false positives)"?%>

    If a scan reports false positives, report the issue to
    [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp).
    For more information about false positives, see
    [ClamAV Reports False Positives](./troubleshooting.html#false-positive-clamav).
    It takes about a week for ClamAV to verify and publish a new database.


## <a id='proxy'></a> Configure HTTP Proxy
If you require a proxy server for ClamAV jobs to connect to the internet to
update their virus definitions, you can configure one.
To do this, do the following:

1. Select the **HTTP Proxy Configuration for ClamAV Jobs** side-tab.
![Configure HTTP Proxy](http-proxy.png)

1. Set **HTTP proxy for ClamAV jobs to get database updates** to **Enabled**.
1. Enter the **Host**, **Port**, **Username** and **Password** in the fields that appear.
1. Click **Save**


## <a id='scheduled'></a> Configure Scheduled Scan
ClamAV can be configured to run a virus scan `hourly` or `daily`.
The default value is `daily`.
The format of these values must be in 24-hour format `HH:MM`.

To change the scheduled scan value, do the following:

1. Click **Scheduled Scans**
![Configure Scheduled Scan](scheduled-scans.png)
<%# TODO: Chris to check if this screenshot is accurate %>

1. Set **Interval for scheduled scans to run** to one of the following:
  * **Hourly**
  * **Daily** (default)
  * **Disabled**
1. (Optional) If you selected **Daily** scheduled scans, you can restrict the interval.
To do this, set **Earliest time that a daily scheduled scan can start** and
**Latest time that a daily scheduled scan can start**.

## <a id="apply-changes"></a> Apply Changes from Your Configuration
Your installation is not complete until you apply your configuration changes.
To do this, follow the procedure below:

1. Return to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
1. Ensure all products are selected and click **Apply Changes**.

##<a id="scan-containers"></a> (Optional) Configure ClamAV to Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers
You can use ClamAV to scan the following:

* Garden containers on the Diego Cell VMs in Pivotal Application Service (PAS)
* Containers on the Kubernetes worker node VMs in Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (Enterprise PKS)

However, duplicate logs about the same file will appear under the `diff`,
`rootfs`, or `merged` directories as a consequence of OverlayFS implementation.

To configure ClamAV to ignore duplicate logs for these directories, see the optional
[Exclude Duplicate Logs on Garden Containers](#garden) or
[Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers in Enterprise PKS](#pks) sections below:


###<a id="garden"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Garden Containers
When ClamAV scan results detect potential malware on the Garden containers,
logs are reported for both the `diff` and `rootfs` directories.

This is because the `rootfs` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer, therefore it is safe to
ignore the `rootfs` directory.
GrootFS mounts the underlying volumes using OverlayFS to a point in the images directory.
This mount point is the `rootfs` directory for the container and is read-write.

For more information about GrootFS OverlayFS implementation, see
[Volumes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/grootfs-disk.html#volumes)
in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

If you would like to configure ClamAV to ignore duplicate logs for these directories,
enter `^/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/(un)?privileged/images/[\w-]+/rootfs/.*$` into the
**Directories and files that will be ignored by ClamAV** field in the **ClamAV Configuration** pane:

![Directories and files that will be ignored by ClamAV](ignore-file.png)

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
    Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
    <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/unprivileged/images/UUID/rootfs</code>
    directory are ignored by ClamAV. <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.</p>

For an example log message, see [Container Log Messages](./monitoring-logs.html#container).


###<a id="pks"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers in Enterprise PKS
When ClamAV scan results detect potential malware on containers of the Kubernetes
worker node VMs in Enterprise PKS, logs are reported for both the
`diff` and `merged` directories.

This is because the `merged` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer, therefore it is safe to
ignore the `merged` directory.

For more information about Docker OverlayFS implementation, see
[Use the OverlayFS storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/)
in the Docker documentation.

If you would like to configure ClamAV to ignore duplicate logs for these directories,
enter `^/var/vcap/store/docker/docker/overlay2/\w+/merged/.*$` into the
**Directories and files that will be ignored by ClamAV** field in the **ClamAV Configuration** pane:

![Directories and files that will be ignored by ClamAV](ignore-file.png)

  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
    Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
    <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/unprivileged/images/UUID/merged</code>
    directory are ignored by ClamAV. <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.</p>

For an example log message, see [Container Log Messages](./monitoring-logs.html#container).
