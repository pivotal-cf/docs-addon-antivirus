<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to install the ClamAV Add-on for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id="prereqs"></a>Prerequisites

To install ClamAV Add-on, you need:

* Named runtime configs

    If you have not already split your runtime config into multiple named files,
    do so before installing or upgrading the ClamAV Add-on for PCF.
    For general information about named runtime config files,
    see <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/configs.html">Configs</a>.

* **A PCF operator with admin rights**---For more information, see [Operators](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/user-types.html#operator) in the Pivotal Cloud Foundry documentation.

* Operations Manager (Ops Manager)

* At least 1 GB of memory free on each VM before deploying ClamAV Add-on.
  ClamAV Add-on uses 610 MB of memory.

* A local mirror to get ClamAV virus updates.
  For instructions on how to set up a local mirror,
  see [Private Local Mirrors](https://www.clamav.net/documents/private-local-mirrors) in the ClamAV documentation.

  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Release version <code>x.x.x</code> in the <code>clamav.yml</code> samples below is arbitrary. Replace it with the version of ClamAV release downloaded from Pivotal Network.</p>

## <a id="create-mfest"></a>Create the ClamAV Manifest

The ClamAV manifest is a YAML file that contains runtime config information for ClamAV Add-on.
To create the ClamAV manifest for your deployment, follow the steps below:

### <a id="linux-template"></a> clamav.yml Template for Linux

1. Create a file named `clamav.yml`, using the following code as a template.

    ```
    releases:
    - name: clamav
      version: x.x.x
    addons:
    - name: clamav
      jobs:
      - name: clamav
        release: clamav
        properties:
          clamav:
            database_mirror: <%= vars.example_ip_1 %>
      include:
        stemcell:
        - os: ubuntu-trusty
        - os: ubuntu-xenial
    ```

2. (Optional) Set the properties `cpu_limit`, `enforce_cpu_limit` and `memory_limit`.
To use these properties, place the following text under the `clamav` subsection of
`clamav.yml`, as shown below:

    ```
    ...
    properties:
      clamav:
        cpu_limit: VALUE-OF-CPU-LIMIT
        enforce_cpu_limit: TRUE|FALSE
        memory_limit: VALUE-OF-MEMORY-LIMIT-IN-BYTES
    ...
    ```
    <code><strong>cpu\_limit</strong></code>: <a name="cpu_limit"></a>
    <ul>
      <li>Limits ClamAV to a percentage of available CPU resources when other processes are using CPU resources.
        Usage may exceed the limit if enough idle CPU cycles are available.</li>
      <li>Set to a whole number less than 100.
        For example, set to <code>50</code> to limit ClamAV to 50% CPU usage when other
        tasks are running.</li>
        <li>The default value is <code>10</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <code><strong>enforce\_cpu\_limit</strong></code>: <a name="enforce_cpu_limit"></a>
    <ul>
      <li>When <code>true</code>, the limit set by <code>cpu\_limit</code> is always enforced.</li>
      <li>When <code>false</code>, the limit set by <code>cpu\_limit</code> is
        only enforced when other processes are using CPU resources.
        Usage may exceed the limit if enough idle CPU cycles are available.</li>
        <li>This property is <code>false</code> by default.</li>
        <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
          If <code>enforce_cpu_limit</code> is set <code>true</code>, ensure <code>cpu_limit</code>
          is set high enough for ClamAV to execute normally.
          If the limit is too strict, ClamAV fails to start.
          For example, on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), an n1-standard-1 VM requires a CPU limit of more than 45%.</p>
    </ul>

    <code><strong>memory\_limit</strong></code>: <a name="memory_limit"></a>
    <ul>
      <li>Limits the maximum amount of user memory (including file cache) in bytes used by ClamAV.</li>
      <li>The default value is <code>1073741824</code>.</li>
    </ul>

###<a id="windows-template"></a>clamav.yml Template for Windows

Create a file named <code>clamav.yml</code> using the following code as a template.

```
releases:
- name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
- name: clamav-windows
  jobs:
  - name: clamav-windows
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        database_mirror: <%= vars.example_ip_1 %>
  include:
    stemcell:
    - os: windows2019
    - os: windows2016
    - os: windows1803
```

### <a id="general-config"></a> General clamav.yml Template Configuration

1. In the <code>database_mirror</code> field of the template, provide the hostname
or IP address of a private ClamAV update mirror.
    Environments that cannot connect to the internet should use an update mirror.
    If you do not specify a value, ClamAV defaults to an S3-based mirror for updates.
    For compliance reasons, only use the S3-based mirror in non-production environments.<br />

    For instructions on how to set up a local mirror, see <a href="https://www.clamav.net/documents/private-local-mirrors">Private Local Mirrors</a> in the ClamAV documentation.

1. (Optional) If you have to use a proxy server to connect to the internet,
add the <code>proxy\_host</code> and <code>proxy\_port</code> properties to your manifest.
<br><br>
If the proxy server needs authentication, add the <code>proxy\_user</code> and
<code>proxy\_password</code> properties, as shown below:

    ```
    releases:
    - name: clamav
      version: x.x.x
    addons:
    - name: clamav
      jobs:
      - name: clamav
        release: clamav
      properties:
        clamav:
          proxy_host: PROXY.LOCALDOMAIN
          proxy_port: PROXY-PORT
          proxy_user: PROXY-USERNAME
          proxy_password: PROXY-SECRET
    ...
    ```

##<a id="download"></a> Download ClamAV Add-on

To download the ClamAV Add-on software binary file and move it to your Ops Manager
virtual machine, perform the steps below.
If you intend to run the ClamAV Add-on on a PCF deployment that includes services
or components that use Ubuntu Xenial stemcells, you should download ClamAV Add-on
v1.4.28 or later.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning: </strong>
   Ensure that you are using named runtime configs.
   For more information, see <a href="#prereqs">Prerequisites</a> above.</p>

1. Download the ClamAV Add-on software binary from the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-clamav-addon) to your local machine.

2. To copy the binary to your Ops Manager VM, run the following command:

    ```
    scp -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY clamav-release.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem clamav-1.3.28.tar.gz ubuntu@192.168.0.2:  </pre>

2. To copy the ClamAV manifest, `clamav.yml` file, to your Ops Manager instance, run the following command:

    ```
    scp -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY clamav.yml ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem clamav.yml ubuntu@192.168.0.2:  </pre>

4. To SSH into Ops Manager, run the following command:

    ```
    ssh -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ubuntu@192.168.0.2</pre>

5. To navigate to the location of the binary on the Ops Manager VM, run the following command:

    ```
    cd PATH-TO-BINARY
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cd ~/clamav-1.3.28.tar.gz</pre>

## <a id='deploy'></a>Deploy the ClamAV Add-on

Perform the following steps to deploy the ClamAV Add-on:

1. Log in to the BOSH Director.
    1. On the Ops Manager VM, create an alias in the BOSH CLI for your BOSH Director IP address. For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh alias-env my-env -e 10.0.0.3</pre>
    1. Log in to the BOSH Director, specifying the newly created alias.
    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env log-in</pre>
1. Upload your release, specifying the path to the tarballed ClamAV binary, by running the following command:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env upload-release ~/clamav-1.3.28.tar.gz</pre>
1. List the releases by running the following command, and confirm that ClamAV appears:
  <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env releases</pre>
1. <a name="update"></a>Update your runtime configuration to include the ClamAV Add-on, specifying the path to the `clamav.yml` file you created above, by running the following command:
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you installed other BOSH add-ons,
    you must merge the ClamAV manifest into your existing add-on manifest.
    Append the contents of `clamav.yml` to your existing add-on YML file.</p>
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav ~/clamav.yml</pre>
1. Verify that your runtime configuration changes match what you specified in the ClamAV manifest by running the following command:
    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env runtime-config --name=clamav</pre>
    For Example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config --name=clamav

## <a id="alerts"></a> Configure Forwarding for ClamAV Alerts

The ClamAV BOSH release writes all alerts to the syslogs of the VMs in your deployment.
You can use syslog forwarding to forward the alerts to a syslog aggregator.

Follow the steps to <a href="http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/cloudform-er-config.html#sys-logging">
    Configure System Logging</a> in the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile.
    The syslog aggregator that you specify receives all alerts generated on PAS VMs, including the ClamAV alerts.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you configure syslog forwarding, ensure there is enough disk space for the logs.
   Make sure that log rotation is frequent enough.
   If in doubt, rotate the logs hourly or when they reach a certain size.
   Pivotal recommends forwarding logs to a remote syslog aggregation system.</p>

## <a id="verify"></a>Verify Your ClamAV Add-on Installation

<ol>
<li><a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh">BOSH SSH</a> into one of the VMs in your deployment.
</li>
<li>Run <code>monit summary</code>. Look for the following processes in the output:
<pre class="terminal">The Monit daemon 5.2.4 uptime: 3d 0h 56m
Process 'clamd'                     running<br/>
Process 'freshclam'                 running</pre></li>
<li>If <code>monit summary</code> does not list <code>clamd</code> and <code>freshclam</code>, do the following:
  <ol>
  <li>Try to start the ClamAV processes by running the following commands:
  <pre class="terminal">
  $ monit start clamd<br>
  $ monit start freshclam</pre></li>
  <li>Run <code>monit summary</code> again. If you do not see the processes mentioned above, check <code>/var/vcap/sys/log/clamav</code> logs for errors.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>If <code>monit summary</code> does list <code>freshclam</code> and <code>clamd</code>, create a file in <code>/var/vcap</code> on the VM with the following contents:
<pre>
X5O!P%@AP[4\PZX54(P^)7CC)7}$EICAR-STANDARD-ANTIVIRUS-TEST-FILE!$H+H*
</pre>
This is a virus signature used to test anti-virus software.</li>
</ol>
After `clamdscan` completes, a notification should appear in `/var/log/syslog`. This scan can take up to an hour.

###<a id="format"></a>ClamAV Log Format

See [Monitoring ClamAV Logs](./monitoring-logs.html)

## <a id="setup-allowlist"></a>Add False Positives to an Allowlist

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Allowlist is available in ClamAV Add-on v1.4.36 and later. </p>

If a scan is reporting false positives, report the issue to
[ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp).
For more information about false positives, see
[ClamAV Reports False Positives](./troubleshooting.html#false-positive-clamav).

It takes about a week for ClamAV to verify and publish a new database.
If a week is too long, the ClamAV release provides the option to add the signature names to an allowlist.

To add signature names to an allowlist, do the following:

1. Add the `whitelist` property and append the false positive signature names.
   For example:
   <pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
  jobs:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        <strong>whitelist:</strong>
        <strong>  - Eicar-Test-Signature</strong>
        <strong>  - Clamav.Test.File-7</strong>
        <strong>  - Win.Test.EICAR_NDB-1</strong>
        <strong>  - Eicar-Signature</strong>
...</code></pre>

1. Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For more information, see steps 4 to 7 of [Deploy the ClamAV Add-on](#deploy).

##<a id="setup-on-access"></a>Enable On-Access Scan
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: On-Access Scan is not supported on Windows.</p>

ClamAV offers immediate file scanning upon file modification. This feature may reduce the time it takes to detect and report malware.

To enable on-access file scanning with the <code>on\_access</code> runtime config property:
<ol>
<li>In the <code>clamav.yml</code> file, add the <code>on\_access</code> property under the <code>clamav</code> property, and set <code>on\_access</code> to <code>yes</code>, as shown in bold:
<pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
  jobs:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        <strong>on_access: yes</strong>
        scheduled: yes
...</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For more information,  see steps 4 to 7 of <a href="#deploy">Deploy the ClamAV Add-on</a> above.</li>
</ol>

##<a id="configure-scheduled-scan"></a>Configure Scheduled Scan

ClamAV can be configured to run a virus scan hourly or daily, with daily scan being the default.

To change the scheduled scan to run hourly:

<ol>
<li>In the <code>clamav.yml</code> file, add the property <code>schedule_interval</code> under the <code>clamav</code> property, and set it to <code>hourly</code>, as shown below:
<pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
  jobs:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        scheduled: yes
        <strong>schedule_interval: hourly</strong>
...</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For more information,  see steps 4 to 7 of <a href="#deploy">Deploy the ClamAV Add-on</a> above.</li>
</ol>

To restrict the time interval when a daily scan runs, do the following:

<ol>
<li>For ClamAV Add-on v1.4.34 and later, restrict the timeframe
    when the scheduled scan can run by specifying a time range in 24-hour format
    in the properties <code>first_scheduled_scan_time</code> and <code>last_scheduled_scan_time</code>,
    as shown below:
<pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
  jobs:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        scheduled: yes
        schedule_interval: daily
        <strong>first_scheduled_scan_time: "2:00"
        last_scheduled_scan_time: "4:30"</strong>
...</code></pre>
</li>
<li> Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For more information,  see steps 4 to 7 of <a href="#deploy">Deploy the ClamAV Add-on</a> above.
</li>
</ol>

##<a id="disable-scheduled-scan"></a>Disable Scheduled Scan

To disable the scheduled scan, do the following:
<ol>
<li>In the <code>clamav.yml</code> file, set the property <code>scheduled</code> to <code>no</code>.</li>
<li>Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For more information,  see steps 4 to 7 of <a href="#deploy">Deploy the ClamAV Add-on</a> above.
</ol>

##<a id="quarantine"></a>Choose the Action on Infected Files

You can configure ClamAV to take action when infected files are found.
By default, a notification is sent to the syslog when an infected file is found.
However, you can specify other actions, as described [Step 2](#step2) below.

<ol>
<li>In the <code>clamav.yml</code> file, add the <code>action</code> property under the <code>clamav</code> property and,
optionally, the <code>action_destination</code> property, as shown below:
<pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
  jobs:
  <span>-</span> name: clamav
    release: clamav
    properties:
      clamav:
        action: ACTION
        action_destination: PATH
...</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Replace <code>ACTION</code> with one of the following values:<a id="step2"></a>
  <ul>
    <li> <code>notify</code>: The default, only send a notification to syslog</li>
    <li> <code>remove</code>: Delete the infected file from the filesystem</li>
    <li> <code>move</code>: Move the infected file to the directory location specified by <code>action_destination</code></li>
    <li> <code>copy</code>: Copy the infected file to the directory location specified by <code>action_destination</code></li>
  </ul>
If you don't supply an action, the function fails.
</li>
<li> Replace <code>PATH</code> with the directory location where you want the infected files moved or copied to.
    The system does not scan the moved-to or copied-to location.
    If the directory path is not valid, the function fails.<br/>
    <br>

    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong>
    If <code>action</code> is <code>move</code> or <code>copy</code>, make sure the <code>action_destination</code> path is also added to the <code>exclude_paths</code>.<br>
    If <code>action_destination</code> is not listed under <code>exclude_paths</code>, ClamAV:<br>
    ∙ Detects the moved or copied file<br>
    ∙ Logs redundant alerts<br>
    ∙ Creates additional copies of the detected file
    </p>

    Example configuration:

<pre><code>releases:
<span>-</span> name: clamav
  version: x.x.x
addons:
  name: clamav
    jobs:
    <span>-</span> name: clamav
      release: clamav
      properties:
        clamav:
          action: move
          action_destination: /var/vcap/data/clamav/found
          exclude_paths:
          - ^/proc/
          - ^/sys/
          - ^/var/vcap/data/clamav/found/

...</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

##<a id="exclude"></a>Exclude Files and Directories

You can configure ClamAV to exclude files and directories from being scanned.
By default, the scan excludes <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code> directories.

To exclude files and directories from the scan, do the following:

1. Add the `exclude_paths` property and append regex matching file paths to the list,
as shown below:
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>:
  Pivotal recommends that you include the <code>/proc</code> and <code>/sys</code>
  directories on the `exclude_paths` list.
  This is because they must be on the list to remain excluded.</p>

    <pre><code>releases:
    <span>-</span> name: clamav
      version: x.x.x
    addons:
      name: clamav
        jobs:
        <span>-</span> name: clamav
          release: clamav
          properties:
            clamav:
              exclude_paths:
              - ^/proc/
              - ^/sys/
              - ADDITONAL-EXCLUSIONS
    ...</code></pre>

1. Apply changes by updating your runtime config.
For how to do this, see steps 4 to 7 of <a href="#deploy">Deploy the ClamAV Add-on</a> above.


###<a id="garden"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Garden Containers

When ClamAV scan results detect potential malware on the Garden containers,
logs are reported for both the `diff` and `rootfs` directories.

This is because the `rootfs` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer.
Therefore, it is safe to ignore the `rootfs` directory.
GrootFS mounts the underlying volumes using OverlayFS to a point in the images directory.
This mount point is the `rootfs` directory for the container and is read-write.

For more information about GrootFS OverlayFS implementation, see
[Volumes](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/grootfs-disk.html#volumes)
in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

To configure ClamAV to ignore duplicate logs for these directories,
do the following:

1. In [Exclude Files and Directories](#exclude) above, add the following pattern to the `exclude_paths` property:

        clamav:
          exclude_paths:
            ...
            # When scanning Garden containers,
            # ignore duplicate log messages from .../UUID/rootfs/
            - ^/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/(un)?privileged/images/[\w-]+/rootfs/.*$

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
      Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
      <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/unprivileged/images/UUID/rootfs</code>
      and <code>/var/vcap/data/grootfs/store/privileged/images/UUID/rootfs</code>
      directories are ignored by ClamAV. <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.</p>

For an example log message, see [Container Log Messages](./monitoring-logs.html#container).


###<a id="pks"></a> (Optional) Exclude Duplicate Logs on Containers in Enterprise PKS

When ClamAV scan results detect potential malware on containers of the Kubernetes
worker node VMs in Enterprise PKS, logs are reported for both the
`diff` and `merged` directories.

This is because the `merged` directory is the projection of
the `diff` directory on top of a base image layer.
Therefore, it is safe to ignore the `merged` directory.

For more information about Docker OverlayFS implementation, see
[Use the OverlayFS storage driver](https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/overlayfs-driver/)
in the Docker documentation.

To configure ClamAV to ignore duplicate logs for these directories,
do the following:

1. In [Exclude Files and Directories](#exclude) above, add the following pattern to the `exclude_paths` property:

        clamav:
          exclude_paths:
            ...
            # When scanning Kubernetes containers,
            # ignore duplicate log messages from .../UUID/merged/
            -  ^/var/vcap/store/docker/docker/overlay2/\w+/merged/.*$

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
      Adding this ignore pattern means that files and directories in the
      <code>/var/vcap/store/docker/docker/overlay2/UUID/merged</code>
      directory are ignored by ClamAV. <code>UUID</code> is the ID of the container.</p>

For an example log message, see [Container Log Messages](./monitoring-logs.html#container).
