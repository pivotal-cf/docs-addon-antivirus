<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to update virus definitions on an internal
<%= vars.product_full %> mirror that is deployed by the Pivotal Anti-Virus Mirror tile.

The Pivotal Anti-Virus Mirror tile and the <%= vars.product_full %>
tile work together as follows:

  - The <%= vars.product_full %> tile runs <%= vars.product_short %> on all BOSH VMs
  by adding it to the BOSH runtime config.
  - The Pivotal Anti-Virus Mirror tile
  creates an internal mirror that is used by the ClamAV components running on BOSH VMs.

##<a id="update"></a>Overview

The ClamAV community regularly updates virus definitions and publishes them to
an external ClamAV database.

How these updated virus definitions propagate to the internal
Anti-Virus Mirror that
BOSH VMs use depends on whether your environment
is running in an online or air-gapped network:

* **[Online Network](#automatic)**: The Anti-Virus Mirror updates its virus definitions automatically.
* **[Air-gapped Network](#manual)**: An operator must manually download new virus definitions
and run `bosh scp` to update them on the internal <%= vars.product_short %> mirror.

For more information and diagrams about this architecture,
see [How Virus Definitions Propagate to VMs](./index.html#propagate).

The following sections describe both of these scenarios
and explain how to manually update virus definitions on the internal <%= vars.product_short %> mirror.

##<a id="automatic"></a>Automatic Updates with Online Networks

When your environment runs on an online network,
the Anti-Virus Mirror VM regularly checks the external ClamAV database every two hours.

When new virus definitions are present on the external database,
Anti-Virus Mirror downloads them automatically.

##<a id="manual"></a>Manually Update on an Air-gapped Network

<%= vars.product_short %> jobs use three virus definitions files, `main.cvd`, `daily.cvd`, and `bytecode.cvd`.
The internal Anti-Virus Mirror serves these three files to all
<%= vars.product_short %> jobs in your environment.

To update the virus definitions:

1. Download the three virus definition files from the ClamAV virus
database mirror or an equivalent external mirror.
You can access the ClamAV mirror at the following URLs:
    * https://database.clamav.net/main.cvd
    * https://database.clamav.net/daily.cvd
    * https://database.clamav.net/bytecode.cvd

1. Copy your downloaded virus definition files to your Ops Manager VM.

    ```
    scp -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY PATH-TO-CVD-FILE ... ubuntu@OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my-key.pem ~/Downloads/main.cvd ~/Downloads/daily.cvd ~/Downloads/bytecode.cvd ubuntu<span>@</span>192.168.0.2: </pre>

1. SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
  For instructions, see [Log in to the Ops Manager VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#ssh) in the Ops Manager
documentation.

1. Find the name of your Anti-Virus Mirror deployment by running:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT deployments | grep p-antivirus-mirror | cut -f1
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env deployments | grep p-antivirus-mirror | cut -f1</pre>

    The deployment name starts with `p-antivirus-mirror-` and is followed by a string of characters.
    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ p-antivirus-mirror-08815ca5ead252c4b8d8</pre>


1. Copy the virus definitions to your internal Anti-Virus Mirror
  by running:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d ANTIVIRUS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME scp /path/to/local/main.cvd /path/to/local/daily.cvd /path/to/local/bytecode.cvd :/var/vcap/data/antivirus-mirror/unvalidated
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">$ bosh -e my-env -d p-antivirus-mirror-4cb8cfbeee717258d72e scp main.cvd daily.cvd bytecode.cvd :/var/vcap/data/antivirus-mirror/unvalidated</pre>

1. Verify that the mirror validated and updated its local copies of the virus
    definitions by running:

    ```
    bosh -e BOSH-ENVIRONMENT -d ANTIVIRUS-DEPLOYMENT-NAME ssh -c "sudo cat FILE | grep \"updated /var/vcap/store\""
    ```

    Where `FILE` is determined by the output destination configured in
    **Anti-Virus Mirror Configuration** of the Pivotal Anti-Virus Mirror tile.
    Use one of the following:

      * `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus-mirror/antivirus-mirror.stdout.log` for stdout
      * `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus-mirror/antivirus-mirror.stderr.log` for stderr
      * `/var/log/syslog` for syslog

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e my-env -d p-antivirus-mirror-4cb8cfbeee717258d72e ssh -c "sudo cat /var/log/syslog | grep \"updated /var/vcap/store\""<br><br>
    2019/05/30 17:16:34 updated /var/vcap/store/antivirus-mirror/validated/bytecode.cvd<br>
    2019/05/30 17:16:40 updated /var/vcap/store/antivirus-mirror/validated/daily.cvd<br>
    2019/05/30 17:16:49 updated /var/vcap/store/antivirus-mirror/validated/main.cvd
    </pre>
