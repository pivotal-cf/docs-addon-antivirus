For product versions and upgrade paths, see [Upgrade Planner](https://upgrade-planner.pivotal.io/).

##<a id="assume"></a>Compatibility and Prerequisites

See the following topics to ensure you have the required component versions and prerequisites:

* [Product Snapshot](./index.html#snapshot)
* [Prerequisites](./install.html#prereqs)

##<a id="upgrade-v1-v2"></a>Replace ClamAV Add-on for PCF v1.x with <%= vars.product_full %> v2.x

To uninstall ClamAV Add-on for PCF v1.x and install <%= vars.product_full %> v2.x in its place:

1. Retrieve the latest runtime config YML by running the following command:
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT runtime-config > PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location where you want to save the runtime configuration.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config > /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. In the runtime config YML, remove all ClamAV properties under the `releases:` and `addons:` sections.

1. Update the runtime config.
  <pre>
    bosh -e ENVIRONMENT update-runtime-config --name=clamav PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  </pre>

    Where:
    * `ENVIRONMENT` is your environment
    * `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location of the runtime configuration you are updating.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
      $ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. To set up the <%= vars.product_full %> tile, follow the instructions in
[Installing and Configuring <%= vars.product_full %>](./install.html).
