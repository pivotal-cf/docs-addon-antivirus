**Release Date: September 18, 2019**

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

  * **<%= vars.product_full_mirror %>** is a new tile that allows for easier deployment of a virus definition database mirror
      * The mirror serves up the virus definition databases for VMs with <%= vars.product_full %> installed.
      * The mirror validates the integrity and authenticity of the definition database.

  * **<%= vars.product_full %>** is now a tile.
      * The tile integrates with the <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> tile.
      * For more information about upgrading,
        see [Upgrading <%= vars.product_full %>](upgrade.html).

  * Updates default cgroup `memory_limit` to 1.5&nbsp;GB
  * Updates default cgroup `cpu_limit` to 50% utilization
  * Supports the `exclude_path` option for Windows
  * Adds `Number of database checks per day` field in the tile to configure the frequency of checking for new virus definition databases
  * <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> supports the cld file format of virus definition and provides integrity check.
  * Updates the bundled ClamAV open source distribution to v0.101.4
  * Updates the go version to v1.12.9


### Security Fixes

This release includes the following security fixes:

  * Updates the bundled ClamAV open source distribution to v0.101.4 to address:

    * Critical [CVE-2019-12900](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12900):
     BZ2_decompress in decompress.c in bzip2 through 1.0.6 has an out-of-bounds
     write when there are many selectors.

    * ClamAV v0.101.4 introduces a scan time limit.
     This limit now resolves ClamAV's "zip bomb" vulnerability.

    For more information about this distribution, see
    [ClamAV 0.101.4](https://blog.clamav.net/2019/08/clamav-01014-security-patch-release-has.html) on the ClamAV blog.

  * Updates the go version to [1.12.9](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.12.minor) to address:

    * High [CVE-2019-9512](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9512), also known as Ping Flood:
        * The attacker sends continual pings to an HTTP/2 peer, causing the peer to build an internal queue of responses.
        Depending on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU, memory, or both, potentially leading
        to a denial of service.

    * High [CVE-2019-9514](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9514), also known as Reset Flood:
        * The attacker opens a number of streams and sends an invalid request over each stream that should solicit a stream of
        RST\_STREAM frames from the peer. Depending on how the peer queues the RST\_STREAM frames, this can consume excess memory,
        CPU, or both, potentially leading to a denial of service.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* <%= vars.product_short_mirror %> outputs a TLS handshake error log
  even though the process is not failing.
  The error looks similar to the following:
      <pre class="terminal">http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:RANDOM-PORT: EOF</pre>
* The clamd app forwards duplicate logs. This is because clamd controller outputs logs to both `/var/vcap/sys/log/monit/clamd.log` and `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus/clamd.log`.
* If you use <%= vars.product_short_mirror %>,
 errors can occur when restoring your deployment with BOSH Backup and Restore (BBR).
 For instructions for resolving this issue,
see [Restoring with BOSH Backup and Restore Fails](./troubleshooting.html#backup-restore).
For information about BBR,
see [Backing Up and Restoring Deployments](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/backup-restore/index.html).
