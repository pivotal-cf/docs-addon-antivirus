## <a id='uninstall-clamav'></a>Uninstall ClamAV Add-on
To uninstall the ClamAV Add-on, follow the steps below:

1. Retrieve the latest runtime config by running the following command:
  ```
  bosh -e my-env runtime-config > PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  ```

    Where `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location that you want to save the runtime configuration.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e my-env runtime-config > /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. In the runtime config, remove all ClamAV properties under the `releases:` and `addons:` sections.

1. Update the runtime config.
  ```
  bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG
  ```

    Where `PATH-TO-SAVE-THE-RUNTIME-CONFIG` is the location of the runtime configuration you are updating.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e my-env update-runtime-config --name=clamav /runtime/config/
    </pre>

1. Navigate to your **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

1. If you are using Ops Manager v2.3 or later, click **Review Pending Changes**.
   For more information about this Ops Manager page,
   see [Reviewing Pending Product Changes](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/review-pending-changes.html).

1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. Wait for the installation to complete.

## <a id='verify-uninstall'></a>Verify the Uninstallation
To verify the uninstallation of the ClamAV Add-on is successful, follow the steps below:

1. Use `bosh ssh` to SSH into one of the VMs in your deployment.
For more information,
see [BOSH SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/install/trouble-advanced.html#bosh-ssh)

1. Run `monit summary`. If ClamAV has uninstalled successfully,
it does not show the `clamd` or `freshclam` processes.
