title: Monitoring Pivotal Anti-Virus Logs
owner: Security Engineering
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic contains sample logs emitted by <%= vars.product_full %>.

These samples can be used to configure a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system
to verify regular activity and generate alerts for virus detections or outdated virus signatures.

##<a id="clamav-logs"></a> <%= vars.product_short %> Logs

There are three distinct <%= vars.product_short %> apps that run on each VM: freshclam, clamd, and clamdscan.
These apps work together to detect viruses and protect the VM.

Each app writes its own log file.
You need to monitor each of these files to know if <%= vars.product_short %>
is working correctly and if viruses have been found.

Pivotal recommends that you enable syslog forwarding so that the messages from each of the three log files
is aggregated into the syslog file on the remote syslog server.
Then you can use your preferred monitoring and alerting tool to review the <%= vars.product_short %> log messages.

For an example of how <%= vars.product_short %> messages appear in the syslog file, see [Syslog Format](#format) below.

For information about each app, see [freshclam](#freshclam-app), [clamd](#clamd-app),
and [clamdscan](#clamdscan-app) below.

###<a id="freshclam-app"></a> freshclam App

The freshclam app updates the database that stores the known virus signatures.

The messages output by the freshclam app indicate when freshclam checks for updates,
what the download progress is, and the downloaded signature version.

The log file for the freshclam app is `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus/freshclam.log`.

###<a id="clamd-app"></a> clamd App

The Clam AntiVirus Daemon (clamd) listens for incoming connections on Unix or the TCP socket.
clamd works with clamdscan to scan files or directories.
The clamd job uses the database of virus signatures that the freshclam job updates.

The messages output by the clamd app show files where viruses are found, the name of the  virus signature,
and any action taken (such as moving, copying, or deleting).

The log file for the clamd app is `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus/clamd.log`.

###<a id="clamdscan-app"></a> clamdscan App

The clamdscan app scans files and directories for viruses using the clamd daemon.

The messages output by the clamdscan app show when a clamdscan has been initiated
and write a scan summary on completion.

The log file for the clamd app is `/var/vcap/sys/log/antivirus/clamdscan.log`.


##<a id="messages"></a>Log Messages

The following tables lists common messages that you see when <%= vars.product_short %> apps write to log files:

##<a id="container"></a>Container Log Messages
Examples of <%= vars.product_short %> log messages from Garden containers and Docker containers are as follows:

* For a Garden container in Pivotal Application Service (PAS)
<pre class="terminal">

<pre class="terminal">

Eicar-Test-Signature FOUND
</pre>


##<a id="format"></a><%= vars.product_short %> Log Format

The logs that <%= vars.product_short %> itself outputs do not adhere to a specific structure.
However, the syslog forwarder component (which is on all VMs)
encapsulates <%= vars.product_short %>'s log, and prepends the necessary headers so that the resulting logs adhere
to the syslog format.

With syslog-forwarder, the syslog format is:

<pre>
	&ltPRI> \
	VERSION \
	TIMESTAMP \
	HOST \
	APP-NAME \
	PROC-ID \
	MSG-ID \
	[instance@47450 \
	director="DIRECTOR" \
	deployment="DEPLOYMENT" \
	group="INSTANCE-GROUP" \
	az="AVAILABILITY-ZONE" \
	id="ID"] \
	MESSAGE \
</pre>

Where:

* <code>\<PRI></code> is `<14>`.
* `APP-NAME` is `freshclam`, `clamdscan`, or `clamd`.
* `MESSAGE` is the output from an <%= vars.product_short %> app.
   Examples of the output messages are shown in [Log Messages](#messages) above.

For example, the first two lines of the "Scan Finished" message appearing in the syslog file below:

<pre class="terminal">
<14> \

2018-12-07T21:48:02.119539Z \
