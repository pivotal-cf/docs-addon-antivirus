This topic provides instructions to verify that the ClamAV-based antivirus add-on works with your Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) deployment
and provides general recommendations for troubleshooting and ensuring that the deployment is being protected as you expect.

## <a id="clamav-installation-issues"></a> ClamAV Installation Issues

### <a id=""></a> Ops Manager Fails to Apply Changes

#### Symptom
Applying changes in Ops Manager fails. The bottom of the changelog contains an error message similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">...
Started updating job nats > nats/0 (12bfae02-b4af-4104-b2bd-227ff07b2d92) (canary). Done (00:02:31)
  Failed updating job etcd_server > etcd_server/0 (f8e492bf-db09-4d38-8a73-5cf69d7b8a11) (canary): 'etcd_server/0 (f8e492bf-db09-4d38-8a73-5cf69d7b8a11)' is not running after update. Review logs for failed jobs: clamd (00:05:53)

Error 400007: 'etcd_server/0 (f8e492bf-db09-4d38-8a73-5cf69d7b8a11)' is not running after update. Review logs for failed jobs: clamd
</pre>

#### Explanation
The ClamAV mirror server was unavailable during initial deployment.

#### Solution
Review the manifest file, and replace the `database_mirror` key with the address of a stable mirror server.
If you do not have a stable mirror server for reliable initial deployment, use the S3-based mirror: `pivotal-clamav-mirror.s3.amazonaws.com`

### <a id="clamav-malware-detection"></a> ClamAV Is Not Detecting Malware

#### Symptom
Malware signature or sample malware is not detected, even though the ClamAV daemon is properly configured.

#### Explanation
Virus signatures are not up-to-date.

#### Solution
First, ensure that the [configuration checks](./install.html#verify) have been done,

that the mirror server is correctly configured and is available on the network from within the PCF private subnet,
and that at least one hour has elapsed.
One hour is the default scan schedule interval.

If the local mirror is up-to-date and ClamAV is still failing to detect a malware sample, you might have encountered a new threat.
Pivotal recommends alerting the community via existing channels and reporting the suspicious file directly to the ClamAV team.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal does not provide support for ClamAV detection failures, mirror coordination, or threat tracking activity.</p>

### <a id='false-positive-clamav'></a> ClamAV Reports False Positives

####Symptom
ClamAV reports a false postive result; a non-malicious file is reported to be a virus.

####Explanation
ClamAV compares files to its database of known malicious patterns.
ClavAV may detect a non-malicious file as a virus due to a coincidental similarity to those patterns.

####Solution
Submit false positive reports to <a href="https://www.clamav.net/reports/fp">ClamAV</a>.
You can also subscribe to the ClamAV email list to be kept up-to-date with ClamAV database changes.
It takes about a week for ClamAV to verify and publish a new database.

### <a id='cpu-spikes-clamav'></a> CPU Spikes While Using ClamAV

####Symptom
ClamAV is taking more CPU resources than assigned in its configuration.

####Explanation
ClamAV resource consumption is restricted using cgroups.
ClamAV is resource-limited whenever other processes are active.
However, cgroups allows ClamAV to occupy more CPU resources when all other processes are idle,
because it does not impact their performance.

####Solution
This is expected behavior from cgroups. If a hard limit is required, configure the `enforce_cpu_limit` Linux property. For more information, see [clamav.yml Template for Linux](./install.html#linux-template) Linux property.

<hr>

### <a id='out-of-memory'></a> Out of Memory While Using ClamAV

####Symptom
ClamAV fails to start and `/var/log/syslog` reports `Memory cgroup out of memory:
Kill process` on the `clamd` process similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">2019-02-20T19:35:40.249205+00:00 localhost kernel: [  254.669948] Memory cgroup out of memory: Kill process 7493 (clamd) score 586 or sacrifice child
2019-02-20T19:35:40.249205+00:00 localhost kernel: [  254.679053] Killed process 7527 (clamd) total-vm:786136kB, anon-rss:626692kB, file-rss:1592kB
</pre>

####Explanation
ClamAV resource consumption is restricted by cgroups.
The `clamd` process is terminated if the memory usage limit is exceeded.
When memory swapping is disabled by other BOSH jobs, the ClamAV resource requires a larger memory limit.

####Solution
This is expected behavior from cgroups.
To configure the memory limit, configure the `memory_limit` Linux property.
For more information, see [clamav.yml Template for Linux](./install.html#linux-template).

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> When updating the memory limit, ensure that all VMs,
including errand VMs, have sufficient memory resources.</p>
<hr>

### <a id='insufficient-cpu'></a> Insufficient CPU Limit While Using ClamAV

#### Symptom
ClamAV fails to start during deployment.
However, the `clamd` and `freshclam` processes eventually run.<br>

The deployment failure log looks similar to the following:

<pre class="terminal">
Task 1071 | 19:40:49 | Updating instance clamav_1: clamav_1/d5cfe4bd-b606-4372-8481-187f4cf57e6c (0) (canary) (00:05:26)
                L Error: 'clamav_1/d5cfe4bd-b606-4372-8481-187f4cf57e6c (0)' is not running after update. Review logs for failed jobs: clamd, freshclam
</pre>
<br>
When you run `bosh -d DEPLOYMENT instances --ps`, you see that the
the `clamd` and `freshclam` processes are running successfully after the failed deployment.

For example:

<pre class="terminal">$ bosh -d clamav_1/d5cfe4bd-b606-4372-8481-187f4cf57e6c instances --ps
Instance                                       Process    Process State  AZ  IPs
clamav_1/d5cfe4bd-b606-4372-8481-187f4cf57e6c  -          running        z1  10.0.0.7
~                                              clamd      running        -   -
~                                              freshclam  running        -   -
</pre>

####Explanation
ClamAV startup is CPU intensive and, if restricted, can prevent ClamAV from starting up correctly.

#### Solutions
+ Ensure `cpu_limit` is set high enough for ClamAV to execute normally.
If the limit is too strict, ClamAV fails to start.
For example, an n1-standard VM on GCP requires `cpu_limit` to be > 45.
For more information, see [clamav.yml Template for Linux](./install.html#linux-template).

+ Set `enforce_cpu_limit` to `false`. This allocates more CPU cycles to ClamAV
if other processes are not using CPU resources.<br>
For more information, see [clamav.yml Template for Linux](./install.html#linux-template).

+ From the **Ops Manager Installation Dashboard**, navigate to the tile with the failing `clamav_1` job.
On the **Resource Config** pane, adjust the **VM Type** for the **ClamAV** job
to have sufficient CPU resources.

### <a id='too-many-files'></a> Too Many Open Files Error While Using ClamAV Mirror

#### Symptom
ClamAV Mirror log reports that there are too many files opened:

<pre class="terminal">
2019/07/29 20:02:41 10.0.0.72 is requesting main.cvd
2019/07/29 20:02:41 http: Accept error: accept tcp 0.0.0.0:80: accept4: too many open files; retrying in 10ms
2019/07/29 20:02:41 http: Accept error: accept tcp 0.0.0.0:80: accept4: too many open files; retrying in 20ms
2019/07/29 20:02:41 http: Accept error: accept tcp 0.0.0.0:80: accept4: too many open files; retrying in 40ms
2019/07/29 20:02:42 http: Accept error: accept tcp 0.0.0.0:80: accept4: too many open files; retrying in 5ms
</pre>
<br>

####Explanation
ClamAV Mirror opens files when a database is requested. There is a limit of how many files can be opened at a given time.

#### Solutions
Increase the number of ClamAV Mirror instances. It is recommended that there is one ClamAV Mirror per 250 instances where ClamAV is installed.
For more information, see [Scale the Number of Deployed Mirrors](./install-mirror.html#scale-deployed-mirror).
